**MeshBase** is a peer-to-peer, offline-first communication library built for **Android devices**.  
It uses **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**, **Wi-Fi Direct** and more to enable resilient, decentralized messaging — no SIM card, no internet, no centralized server required.

It’s a powerful foundation for:
- 🌍 Disaster-resilient communication systems
- 🚫 Internet-blackout messaging apps
- 📡 Ad-hoc group chat in remote areas

## 🔥 Inspiration
- **High telecom costs** in rural or underserved areas
- **Communication breakdowns** during war or political unrest
- **Emergency coordination** when networks go down
- **Lack of open-source mesh tools** (e.g. Bridgefy is closed and commercial)

## 🛠 Features
### ✅ Library Includes:
- 🔁 **Multi-hop routing** (Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector–inspired)
- 🔐 **End-to-end encryption** using RSA 2048 & SHA-256 fingerprinting
- 📤 **Binary file support** (e.g. image sharing)
- 🔍 **Dynamic discovery** of nearby devices using Wi-Fi Direct and BLE
- 💬 **One-to-one chat**, offline storage, and delivery retry system
